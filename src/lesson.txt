Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')?
ChatGPT
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" occurs because the data object is undefined or null when the map function is called. This usually happens when the data hasn't been loaded yet or there was an error in fetching it.

You need to ensure that the data variable is defined and not null before calling the map function on it. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code to handle these scenarios:

Add a loading state to handle when the data is being fetched.
Add an error state to handle any errors that occur during the fetch.
Ensure the data variable is defined before trying to map over it.
Here's the updated code with these checks:

Explanation:
Check for isLoading and error:

if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
if (error) return <div>Error loading data</div>;
These checks ensure that you handle the loading and error states correctly.

Check if data is defined before calling map:

data && data.map((todo) => ( ... ))
This check ensures that data is defined before attempting to call map on it. If data is undefined or null, the map function will not be called, preventing the error.

By incorporating these changes, your component will handle the different states of data fetching gracefully and avoid errors related to undefined or null data.
